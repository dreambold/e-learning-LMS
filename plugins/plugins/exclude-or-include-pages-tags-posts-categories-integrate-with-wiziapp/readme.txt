== Description ==

This plugin enables you to exclude content from your desktop website or from your WiziApp powered mobile Apps. Use this plugin for publishing content exclusively to your mobile and/or desktop visitors.

This plugin adds a checkbox, "Display on your website" to your Pages, Tags, Links and Categories, which is checked by default.

In order to exclude a Page or a Tag or a Category or a Link from your website, just uncheck the checkbox and users will not see this content in your web site.
In order to exclude a post, create a Tag and name it for example "Exclude from website" uncheck the "Display on your web site" checkbox and add this tag to the posts you would like to exclude.

This plugin is also integrated with your [Wiziapp](http://www.wiziapp.com/) powered mobile App.
For this purpose the plugin displays an additional checkbox named "Exclude from your mobile App".
You can uncheck the "Display on your mobile App" checkbox and this content will not be displayed on the mobile App, but will still be displayed on your Web site.

The "Exclude" plugin also enables you to include or create content exclusively for your [Wiziapp](http://www.wiziapp.com/) powered mobile App.
This can be done by un checking the "Display on your web site" and keeping the "Display on your mobile App" checked.
